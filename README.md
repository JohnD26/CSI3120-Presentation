# Functional Programming Presentation

## Overview

This repository contains the slides for a presentation on **Functional Programming**, prepared as part of the Task 12 of the **CSI 3120: Programming Language Concepts** coursework. The topic was divided among students, with each of us covering different aspects of functional programming.

## My Contribution

I was responsible for a subsection of the broader topic, focusing on:

- **ML**
- **Haskell**
- **F#**
- **Support for Functional Programming in Primarily Imperative Languages**
- **Comparison of Functional and Imperative Languages**

These sections delve into the theoretical and practical aspects of these languages, highlighting their unique features and real-world applications.

## Key Features

- **ML, Haskell, and F#**: Covered their histories, core concepts, and how they are applied in both academic and industrial settings.
- **Functional Features in Imperative Languages**: Explored how functional programming principles are adopted in languages like Python, JavaScript, and C#.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Provided a detailed comparison of functional and imperative paradigms, focusing on their strengths and ideal use cases.

## Example-Based Approach

The presentation emphasizes a hands-on approach, using concrete coding examples to illustrate key concepts. This method ensures that complex ideas are conveyed in an understandable and practical manner.
